A fin-fan is a type of heat exchanger that forces air over a set of coils to cool the process. It is also referred to as an air cooled heat exchanger. Fin-fan heat exchangers are generally used where a process system generates heat which must be removed, but for which there is no local use.

My current employer, an Oil and Gas producer, utilises many fin-fan systems in the production of liquified natural gas.  

This project will use a machine learning model to predict future failure of a system and provide an early warning system to production staff.
